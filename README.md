# To-Do List

This project is a simple web-based to-do list application implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add and manage tasks in a visually appealing interface.

## Features Implemented

- **Task Input**: Users can enter new tasks in the provided input box.
- **Add Button**: Clicking the "Add" button or pressing the Enter key adds the task to the list.
- **Task List**: Tasks are displayed as a list of items.
- **Toggle Completion**: Clicking on a task marks it as completed, indicated by a strike-through effect.
- **Delete Task**: Clicking on the delete icon (X) removes the task from the list.
- **Persistent Data**: The application uses the browser's local storage to save and retrieve task data, ensuring that tasks persist even after page reloads.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface adapts to different screen sizes using media queries, providing a seamless experience on mobile and desktop devices.
- **Current Year Display**: The footer of the page dynamically displays the current year using JavaScript.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that defines the visual styles and layout of the application.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that implements the task management functionality.
- `scriptYear.js`: A separate JavaScript file used to dynamically display the current year in the footer.
